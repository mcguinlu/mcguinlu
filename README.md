# Hi, Iâ€™m Luke ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I am an enthusiastic R user/developer and maintain several
research-orientated open-source R packages including
[`robvis`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis) and
[`medrxivr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/medrxivr), in addition to some
smaller utility/learning packages
(e.g.Â [`pathformatr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/pathformatr)). I blog
about some things that interest me at
[Hexations](https://mcguinlu.netlify.app/).

I am an NIHR Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Bristol
Medical School, where I use large electronic health record databases
(e.g.Â CPRD) and evidence synthesis methods to examine the relationship
between blood lipid levels and dementia risk.

Outside of work, I am an avid fan of running,
[LEGO](https://mcguinlu.netlify.app/2021/02/02/baby-yoda-in-r/) and
really terrible movies.

### Is it the weekend??

Itâ€™s not the weekend. . . yet.
