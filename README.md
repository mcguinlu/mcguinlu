# Hi, I’m Luke 👋

### About me

I am an enthusiastic R user/developer and maintain several
research-orientated open-source R packages including
[`robvis`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis) and
[`medrxivr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/medrxivr), in addition to some
smaller utility/learning packages
(e.g. [`pathformatr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/pathformatr)). I blog
about some things that interest me at
[Hexations](https://mcguinlu.netlify.app/).

Outside of work, I am an avid fan of running,
[LEGO](https://mcguinlu.netlify.app/2021/02/02/baby-yoda-in-r/) and
really terrible movies.

### Is it the weekend??

We interrupt this broadcast for an important announcement - it’s the
weekend!

This is a simple test of using GitHub Actions to automatically render a
RMarkdown file each morning, and update the text above. See the
underlying RMarkdown file
[here](https://github.com/mcguinlu/mcguinlu/blob/master/README.Rmd).
