# Hi, I’m Luke 👋

### About me

I am an enthusiastic R user/developer, and maintain several
research-orientated open-source R packages including
[`robvis`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis) and
[`medrxivr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/medrxivr), in addition to some
smaller utility/learning packages
(e.g. [`pathformatr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/pathformatr)).

Outside of work, I am an avid fan of running,
[LEGO](https://mcguinlu.netlify.app/2021/02/02/baby-yoda-in-r/) and
really terrible movies.
