### About me

I am an NIHR Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Bristol Medical School, where I use large electronic health record (EHR) databases and evidence synthesis methods to examine the relationship between blood lipid levels and dementia risk.

I am an enthusiastic R user/developer and maintain several research-orientated open-source R packages including [`robvis`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/mcguinlu/robvis) and [`medrxivr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/mcguinlu/medrxivr), in addition to some smaller utility/learning packages (e.g. [`pathformatr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/mcguinlu/pathformatr)).

Outside of work, I am an avid fan of running, [LEGO](https://mcguinlu.netlify.app/2021/02/02/baby-yoda-in-r/) and really terrible movies.

### Is it the weekend??

This is a simple test of using GitHub Actions to automatically render a RMarkdown file each morning, and update the text above. See the underlying RMarkdown file [here](https://github.com/mcguinlu/mcguinlu/blob/master/README.Rmd).
